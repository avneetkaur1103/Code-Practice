* Process Vs Threads:

PROCESS:
each process has 1 thread running and they communicate through IPC channels like pipe, msg queues, files,etc.
Process is slow to start as OS has to allocate bunch of internal resources.
process has more overhead while running, e.g., OS has to provide a lot of protection so that one process accidentally does not overstep another process.

THREAD:
each process has one or more threads which communicate through shared memory.
thread is faster to start; lightweight process.
thread has lower overhead.
communication thru shared memory is faster than IPC mechanisms.
disadv - difficult to implement, need to take care of multithreading issues.
       - unlike multiprocessing, cannot be run on distributed systems.


#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void func(){
       std::cout<<"Hello World!"<<std::endl;
}

int main(){
       std::thread t1(func);
       t1.join(); // main thread will wait for t1 fo finish
       t1.detach(); //t1 will run freely on its own, main will finish independently, c++                        will claim resources used by t1 -- daemon process
       
       if(t1.joinable())  //Check if thread is joinable, else program will crash
              t1.join(); // we can join or detach a thread only once in its lifetime.
              
       return 0;       
}
