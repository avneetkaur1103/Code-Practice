* Terminology:

1. Replication : Replication refers to frequently copying the data across multiple machines.
    Post replication, multiple copies of the data exists across machines.
    
2. Consistency: Assuming you have a storage system which has more than one machine, consistency implies that the data is same across the cluster,
            so you can read or write to/from any node and get the same data. Eventual consistency - sync eventually.
            
3. Availability: Availability refers to the ability to always respond to queries ( read or write ) irrespective of nodes going down.

4. Partition Tolerance: In context to database cluster, cluster continues to function even if 2 nodes cannot communicate.

5. Vertical scaling and Horizontal scaling: Horizontal scaling is adding more servers. Vertical scaling is to increase resources - RAM, CPU, Storage, etc.

6. Sharding: Sharding refers to splitting the very large database into smaller, faster and more manageable parts called data shards.

* CAP Theorem suggests that in a distributed system, it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee all 3 - Availability, consistency & partition tolerance.

* Why Master-Slave db synchro?
1. Master is less burdened with queries and replica is less burdened with writes, CPU availability is more
