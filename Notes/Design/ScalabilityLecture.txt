* Web(Shared) Hosting vs VPSes: Sharing host means sharing server(s) and its resources with other websites - storage, bandwidth, etc. Virtual Private Server creates a virtual environment that imitates a dedicated server (where you get a chunk of server(or VM), and all its resources, to yourself), but within a shared hosting environment. VPS are more secure and outperforms shared hosting. Although owner of VPS server might have access to VM, depending on hypervisor used.
Example - Amazon's EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), lets you spawn and create multiple VMs (web or database - on demand) as long one is willing to pay some amount per minute; can remove when popularity subsides.
* Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling: In vertical scaling we can increase - CPU (Cores,Cache), Disk, RAM, etc. But we are gonna hit threshold  at somepoint, run out of either financial resources to upgrade or state of art in technology.
Types of Disk/harddrives - PATA(old), SATA, SAS(serial attached SCSI
